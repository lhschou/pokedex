#Pokedex app 

Pokedex displays a searchable list of pokemon. Each pokemon, when clicked, displays a modal with further details on the pokemon (image, weight, types, abilities and height). 

Details on the pokemon are fetched from an external API, pokeapi: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150
